# Treelet Component

Not going to lie this was pretty fun.  
To run:  
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

Stuff I didn't have time to get to:  
- "Caching" fetched data, wanted to use something like `ContextAPI` to save parts of the tree and then pass a prop such as `cache` or something in that area to tell the component not to go and get the data again.

Have fun!
